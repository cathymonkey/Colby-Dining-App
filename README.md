Before running the requirements.txt, remember to create a virtual environment!

- Create a virtual environment using conda (be careful with the Python version; some version such as Python 3.12 is not compatible with the requirements of this app):

    ``` conda create -n [yourenvname] python=3.11```


- Activate a virtual environment:

    ``` source activate [yourenvname] ``` or ``` conda activate [yourenvname] ```

- Deactivate a virtual environment:

    ``` conda deactivate ```

- Remove a virtual environment:

    ``` conda remove -n [yourenvname] --all ```
